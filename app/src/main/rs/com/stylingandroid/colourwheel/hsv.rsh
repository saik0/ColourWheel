 * Converting from HSV to RGB leads to C1 discontinuities, for the RGB components
 * are driven by picewise linear segments. Using a cubic smoother (smoothstep) makes
 * the color transitions in RGB C1 continuous when linearly interpolating the hue H.
 *
 * C2 continuity can be achieved as well by replacing smoothstep with a quintic
 * polynomial. Of course all these cubic, quintic and trigonometric variations break
 * the standard (http: *en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), but they look better.
